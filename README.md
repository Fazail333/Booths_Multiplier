# Booth's Multiplier for 16-bit Signed and Unsigned Multiplication

## Overview
  This repository contains an implementation of Booth's Multiplier, a hardware algorithm widely used for multiplying binary numbers efficiently. The implementation supports both signed and unsigned 16-bit multiplication.


## Description

  Booth's Multiplier is an algorithm that performs binary multiplication using a combination of addition and shifting operations. It is known for its efficiency in reducing the number of partial products, making it suitable for hardware implementations.

## Languages Used
  * System Verilog
  * C++
  * Makefile 

# Key Features

  * Support for Signed and Unsigned Multiplication:  
    The multiplier is designed to handle both signed and unsigned 16-bit multiplication, providing flexibility for various use cases.

  * Efficient Bit Manipulation: 
    The implementation optimizes the multiplication process by efficiently handling bit manipulations and reducing the number of partial products.


## Environments Used

  * Linux Ubuntu 22.04.2
